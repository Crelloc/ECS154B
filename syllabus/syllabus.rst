GitHub
~~~~~~

We will use GitHub_ as the main website and entry point for all course information.
The version of documents found on GitHub are the canonical versions of all documents.
Other downloaded versions of documents may become out of date.
If I make changes to those documents, they will appear first on GitHub.

GitHub will contain this document and assignments.

Canvas
~~~~~~

We will be using Canvas_ for some things.

Gradescope
~~~~~~~~~~

We will use Gradescope_ for returning quizzes, the midterm, and the final.
Gradescope gives you a graded PDF version of your test, along with a rubric, immediately after we're done grading.
You will receive an email from Gradescope to make your account after we grade the first test.

Piazza
~~~~~~

We will use Piazza_ for class discussions outside of the classroom.
If you haven't used Piazza before, it's a cool tool that is essentially a message board for the class.
Both Justin and I will be on Piazza to answer questions.

It's best to ask your questions on Piazza.
That way, all of your classmates can see the answer instead of emailing Justin or me.
Additionally, you might get a much faster response from one of your classmates!

Through asking and answering questions on Piazza, you improve your understanding of the material, and improve other students' understanding as well.
As an incentive to answer other students' questions and participate, I will drop your lowest quiz score if you consistently participate on Piazza.
I will check Piazza participation and drop the lowest score at the end of the quarter.

In the spirit of the above, please ask questions as public questions on Piazza, if possible.
This way, your question, and the answer to your question, can help somebody else who might have the same question.
We will change questions asked privately to public, if we deem it appropriate.
If your question involves code you've written, or is about a personal issue, we will leave those private.

10% of your grade is tied to participation, much of which will take place over piazza.
The benchmark for good piazza participation is at least 10 questions asked, answered, or follow ups throughout the quater.

Regrade Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Regrade requests must be made within one week of the return of the assignment or test.

Accommodations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The exam schedule is available on the schedule_.
Per `official UC Davis policy`_, if you have an accommodation request from the `Student Disability Center`_, or have any conflicts with exam times for religious observances, you must notify me **by the fourth class, 16 January 2018**.

Assignments and Tests
---------------------

Homeworks
~~~~~~~~~


Labs
~~~~

These will primarily by Logisim assignments.

Late assignments
****************

If you turn in a lab late, you will lose points. The percentage of points you will lose is given by the equation below.
This will give you partial points up to 72 hours after the due date and penalizes you less if you barely miss the deadline.

.. GithHub doesn't like to render the above.
    fraction\ of\ points = -1 \times \frac{{hours\ late}^3}{72^3} + 1
